# Test Fix Summary

## Model Consistency Issues

1. **Instructor Model Field Inconsistency**
   - Changed `role` field to `type` for consistency with tests
   - Added missing `department` field
   - Added `user_id` field and relationship to User model
   - Fixed enum values to use `instructor`/`assistant` instead of `hoca`/`aras_gor`

2. **Schema and Model Alignment**
   - Updated schema fields to match model fields
   - Added conversion between legacy values and new values
   - Added validation for backward compatibility
   - Updated to_dict() method to include all fields

3. **Table Definition Issues**
   - Fixed duplicate `project_assistants` table definition
   - Added `primary_key=True` to columns for consistency
   - Added `extend_existing=True` flag to all tables
   - Changed relationship definition to use string reference instead of direct object reference

## Test Environment Fixes

1. **Test Utilities**
   - Updated `create_random_instructor` to match the new model structure
   - Added support for new fields like `department`
   - Added random selection of instructor type
   - Fixed user relationship handling

2. **Test Assertions**
   - Updated test assertions to match the new model fields
   - Changed field references from `role` to `type`
   - Added tests for `department` field

## Service Layer Updates

1. **Instructor Service**
   - Updated field mapping in create method
   - Renamed `get_instructors_by_role` to `get_instructors_by_type`
   - Updated filter conditions to use the new field names
   - Added proper mapping of schema to model fields

2. **Database Migration**
   - Created migration to update existing records
   - Adds new columns: `department` and `user_id`
   - Renames `role` column to `type` 
   - Updates existing values to use new enum format

## API Endpoint Compatibility

   - Updated endpoint processing to use `type` field
   - Enhanced error handling with more descriptive messages

## General Best Practices

1. **Field Standardization**
   - Used consistent naming conventions across models and schemas
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Made enum values consistent and meaningful

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README with comprehensive information
   - Documented migration process for users
   - Provided examples of using the new fields
